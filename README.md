Image Caption Generator using React, TensorFlow, ANN, and Soft Computing
This project is an Image Caption Generator developed using React framework in conjunction with TensorFlow, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Soft Computing techniques. The application allows users to upload images, which are then processed through a sophisticated neural network model to generate descriptive captions for the uploaded images.

Features
Image Upload: Users can easily upload their desired images through a user-friendly interface.
Caption Generation: Utilizes a TensorFlow-powered ANN model combined with Soft Computing methodologies to analyze and generate accurate captions for the uploaded images.
React Framework: Built using the React framework, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-caption-generator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
'''
cd image-caption-generator
'''
Install dependencies:

npm install
'''
Start the application:

npm start
Usage
Once the application is running, access it through your browser. Upload an image using the provided interface, and the system will process the image using the TensorFlow-based ANN model and Soft Computing techniques to generate a descriptive caption for the image.

Technologies Used
React: Front-end development framework for building user interfaces.
TensorFlow: Machine learning library used for the development and deployment of machine learning models.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A computational model inspired by the human brain, utilized for image analysis and caption generation.
Soft Computing: Techniques used for handling uncertain, imprecise, or approximate information, contributing to more nuanced analysis and caption generation.
